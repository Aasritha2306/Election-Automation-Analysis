"# Election-Automation-Analysis" 
 This project focuses on a thorough election audit conducted through Python programming to efficiently analyze and visualize election data. The primary aim is to deliver precise and reliable results for a recent local congressional election. 
 
 The audit encompasses several key elements, such as total votes, voter turnout per county, percentage of votes per county, identification of the county with the highest turnout, and determining the winning candidate along with their vote count and percentage. By leveraging Python's capabilities, the project seeks to streamline the auditing process and provide actionable insights into the electoral landscape. 
 
 Ultimately, it endeavors to enhance understanding of Python for data analysis while contributing to the integrity and transparency of the democratic process.
